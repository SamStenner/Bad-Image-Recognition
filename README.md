# Image Recognition Tool by Sam Stenner

I wrote this program as part of my A-Level Computer Science project, worth 30% of my final mark.

Mark achieved: 75/75.

The code is therefore clearly flawed; I don't want to change the code, as that wouldn't fairly reflect on my ability at the time of creation.
Instead, I intend to create a 'post-mortem' of the project, where I analyse both the good and the bad. This will help me to identify areas that
could have been better.
